# Arogya Mitra

## Project Overview
Arogya Mitra is a AI-based healthcare application designed to ease the consultation process between doctors and patients. It streamlines the healthcare process by enabling AI-powered chatbot, online doctor consultations, and medication reminders.

## ü©∫ Problem Solved

Many patients struggle with managing prescriptions, talking to doctors, and remembering medication timings ‚Äî while doctors face issues like not having enough background before consultations and spending time on manual prescription tasks. **Arogya Mitra** solves these by:

- Using an AI chatbot that talks to the patient and asks questions to understand their health problem.
- Summarizing this conversation and sending it to the doctor before the video consultation.
- Helping the doctor quickly understand the patient‚Äôs condition and focus on treatment.
- Letting the doctor prescribe medicines and tests during the video call with simple clicks.
- Allowing doctors to choose medicine timings (morning, afternoon, night), which are used to automatically set reminders for the patient.
- Sending patients reminders so they take medicines on time and follow treatment properly.


### Key Features

- ***Medical Test Record Upload** via a scanner.
